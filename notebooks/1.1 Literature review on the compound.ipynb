    "One of the greatest challenges this century, is finding alternative, sustainable, enviromental friendly energy sources. By means of that hydrogen is considered an optimal energy source due to its high output energy per unit of mass and its only combustion product H2O (Xu et al., 2019). Rightnow the production of hydrogen is  neither economically efficient nor sustainable, as a huge part of the produced hydrogen comes from fossil fuels. Further sources of hydrogen production are: steam-methane reforming, methanol steam forming or electrolysis of water. Solar energy, Solar photovolatic and Photon-eletcrolysis are examples for renewable methdos with the ability to produce hydrogen. However these methods lack in efficiency (Knzouz et al., 2020).\n",

    "Owing to the efficent solar energy conversion and easy cultivation, algae represents an assuring organism for Hydrogen production (Xu et al., 2019). The hydrogen formation is catalzyed by the [FeFe] Hydrogenase, which uses electrons from the photsynthetic light reactions and is localized in the chloroplast stroma (Murthy et Ghirardi, 2013).\n",
